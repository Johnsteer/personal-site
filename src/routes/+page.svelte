            I've recently been binging content from Fireship and ThePrimeTime and
            it made me want to learn how to build web apps so here I am starting
            a journey building my personal site. Forcing myself to write everything
            myself and not use Cursor/Claude so I actually learn things. I tried React
            but idc about job market I think Svelte is cooler so I'm using it.
            I WILL FINISH THIS PROJECT AND DEPLOY IT ON GOOGLE CLOUD RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also doing all the html/css from
            scratch cause it's more fun than having AI generate it. Following along the Svelte 
            interactive tutorial to figure stuff out.
